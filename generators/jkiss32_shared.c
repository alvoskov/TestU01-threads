/**
 * @file jkiss32.c
 * @brief JKISS is a version of KISS algorithm (2007 version) by J. Marsaglia
 * with paramteres tuned by David Jones.
 * @details It doesn't use multiplication: it is a combination or xorshift32,
 * discrete Weyl sequence and AWC (add with carry) generator. Doesn't require
 * 64-bit integers.
