/**
 * @file kiss96.c
 * @brief KISS generator: the version from DIEHARD test suite.
 * @details This version of KISS generator was suggested by G.Marsaglia
 * and included in his DIEHARD test suite. It is a combined generator
 * made from 32-bit LCG ("69069"), xorshift32 and some generalized
 * multiply-with-carry PRNG:
 *
 * \f[
 * z_{n} = 2z_{n-1} + z_{n-2} + c_{n-1} \mod 2^{32}
 * \f]
 *
 * The algorithm for this MWC is taken from DIEHARD FORTRAN source code
 * and uses some bithacks to implement it without 64-bit data types.
 *
 * @copyright The KISS96 algorithm was developed by George Marsaglia.
 *
 * Reentrant implementation for SmokeRand:
 *
 * (c) 2025 Alexey L. Voskov, Lomonosov Moscow State University.
