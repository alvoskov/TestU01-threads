/**

 * @brief Implementation of flea32x1 PRNG suggested by Bob Jenkins.
 * @details A simple non-linear PRNG that passes almost all statistical tests
 * except `mod3n`. There were several modifications of flea, the implemented
 * variant is from PractRand 0.94 by Chris Doty-Humphrey.
 *
 * WARNING! THE MINIMAL PERIOD OF FLEA32x1 IS UNKNOWN! It was added mainly for
 * testing the `mod3` test and shouldn't be used in practice!
