/**
 * @file sfc32.c
 * @brief SFC32 (Small Fast Chaotic 32-bit) PRNG with period at least 2^{32}.
 * @details This generator is one of the fastest because it doesn't use
 * multiplications. It slightly remembers LFSR based generators but includes
 * a lot of additions. Addition is non-linear operation in GF(2) that prevents
 * problem with MatrixRank and LinearComp tests. The theory behind SFC32
 * is not clear.
 *
 * WARNING! MINIMAL PERIOD IS 2^{32}! IT IS NOT ENOUGH FOR RELIABLE PRACTICAL
 * USAGE! Probability to achieve it is low but exactly unknown (even SFC16
 * with 16-bit counter usually passes 32TiB PractRand; but bad seeds are
 * possible).
 *
 * SFC32 passes `brief`, `default` and `full` batteries.
 * It also passes BigCrush (TestU01) and PractRand.
 *
 * @copyright SFC32 algorithm is developed by Chris Doty-Humphrey,
 * the author of PractRand (https://sourceforge.net/projects/pracrand/).
 * Some portions of the source code were taken from PractRand that is
 * released as Public Domain.
