TestU01-threads is an extension of TestU01 library that allows to run
SmallCrush, Crush, BigCrush and pseudoDIEHARD test batteries in
a multi-threaded mode. TestU01-threads doesn't modify the original
library and just calls tests from it using its own multi-threaded
dispatcher. It also allows to send PRNG output to stdout that is
required for testing with PractRand. The key features are:

- Multi-threaded test batteries from TestU01 without modification
  of TestU01 itself. It allows to use the precompiled library
  in some GNU/Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu)
- Allows to repeat the specified test from the specified battery
  without rerunning other tests just by command line arguments.
- C and C++ interfaces that is designed especially for enveloping
  TestU01 objects/structures. C interface is designed especially
  for making external modules (SO/DLL).
- Can send PRNG output to PractRand by means of file streams.
  Both 32-bit and 64-bit PRNGs are supported.
- Some examples of PRNG including CSPRNG ChaCha12.

Previous attemps to make multithreaded TestU01 were based on rewriting some
tests using parallel programming, e.g. OpenMP. However, they were not completed
and don't include full SmallCrush, Crush, BigCrush and pseudoDIEHARD batteries.

TestU01-threads uses an entirely different approach: it doesn't modify the original
TestU01 library but just replaces single-threaded batteries implementation from
`bbattery.c` (sequental call of statistical tests) to its own multithreaded version
(parallel call of statistical tests from different threads). These statistical tests
are reentrant.

C module interface
==================

A module with PRNG implementation that supports C API should export the next
three functions:

- `int gen_initlib(CallerAPI *intf)` - initializes the library and gets
   a pointer to the structure with pointers to some functions of TestU01-threads
   library, e.g. for obtaining seeds, controlling dynamic memory.
- `int gen_closelib(void)` - called before closing the library.
- `int gen_getinfo(GenInfoC *gi)` - should fill the `GenInfoC` structure
   with information about generator (mainly with pointer to its callback
   functions)

C modules should be compiled as freestanding, i.e. don't use any functions from
standard library and other libraries. However, CallerAPI structure contains
pointer to some functions useful for PRNG construction:

- `get_seed64` - get random 64-bit seed using RDSEED and/or XXTEA CSPRNG.
- `malloc` - pointer to malloc function from C standard library.
- `free` - pointer to free function from C standard library.
- `printf` - pointer to printf function.
- `strcmp` - pointer to strcmp function from C standard library.


The next fields in GenInfoC structure should be filled by `gen_getinfo`:

- `name` - generator name, will be used in reports.
- `init_state` - initializes the generator state.
- `delete_state` - deletes the generator state.
- `get_u01` - returns the double pseudorandom number.
- `get_bits32` - returns the uint32_t pseudorandom number.

The next fields are optional but may be filled:

- `get_bits64` - returns the uint64_t pseudorandom number.
- `get_array32` - fills the uint32_t array buffer with pseudorandom numbers.
- `get_array64` - fills the uint64_t array buffer with pseudorandom numbers.
- `run_self_test` - runs the internal self-test.

The next fields are filled in GenInfoC before `gen_getinfo` is called and used
to transfer information to the PRNG initialization

- `options` - string with generator options


Compilation
===========

The program can be compiled for Linux or MS Windows using GCC compiler
and CMake building system. For some Linux distributions it is possible
to install TestU01-1.2.3 from repositories. E.g. for Ubuntu the next
packages should be installed:

- libtestu01-0:amd64 (contains the compiled TestU01 library)
- libtestu01-0-dev-common (contains the TestU01 header files)

For MS Windows the TestU01 library should be compiled from its source code.
The original TestU01-2009 uses GNU Autoconf for building, and it may be
simpler to use modifications with CMake support, e.g.:

- https://github.com/JamesHirschorn/TestU01-CMake
